"Single cell data relating to Ali HR et al. Nat Cancer 2020. Comprising cleaned data, excluding cells affected by artifacts, used for principal analyses. ",
ColumnName,Description
metabricId,METABRIC patient identifier (MB-####): can be used to link data to other public METABRIC data
core_id,Tissue core identfier : up to a maximum of 3; the vast majority of tumours were represented by one tissue spot hence have only one id.
ImageNumber,Image identifier: needed in addition to metabricId and core_id to account for interrupted image acquisitions (ie acquisition of some tissue spots was interrupted and subsequently resumed).
ObjectNumber,Numeric cell identifier (unique per image); corresponds to cell mask integers.
