Study Title	Imaging mass cytometry and cell masks for 483 breast tumour samples from the METABRIC study 

Study Type	image cytometry 																																
Study Type Term Source REF	OMIT																																
Study Type Term Accession	OMIT_0019157																																
Study Description	Genomic alterations shape cell phenotypes and the structure of tumour ecosystems in poorly defined ways. To investigate these relationships, we used imaging mass cytometry to quantify the expression of 37 proteins with subcellular spatial resolution in 483 tumours from the METABRIC cohort. Single-cell analysis revealed cell phenotypes spanning epithelial, stromal, and immune types. Distinct combinations of cell phenotypes and cell-cell interactions were associated with genomic subtypes of breast cancer. Epithelial luminal cell phenotypes separated into those predominantly impacted by mutations and those affected by copy-number aberrations. Several features of tumour ecosystems, including cellular neighbourhoods, were linked to prognosis, illustrating their clinical relevance. In summary, systematic analysis of single-cell phenotypic and spatial correlates of genomic alterations in cancer revealed how genomes shape both the composition and architecture of breast tumour ecosystems and will enable greater understanding of the phenotypic impact of genomic alterations.
